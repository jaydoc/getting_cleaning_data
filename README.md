The script run_analysis.R will require the Samsung data folder downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
to be extracted to the working directory. Alternatively you can instruct R to use the UCI HAR Datatset as the working directory. The script expects that the directory structure remain unaltered, 
otherwise it will error out. Then running the run_analysis script by sourcing it to R will perform the analysis required and output clean data to a file called tidy.txt that will be saved to the working 
directory of R.
